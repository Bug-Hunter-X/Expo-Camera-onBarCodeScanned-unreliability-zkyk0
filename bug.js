This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` function may not be called consistently, or may stop working after a certain number of scans. This is especially likely to happen if the scanning is happening continuously or frequently.  This can be observed with a simple barcode scanner app. The barcode is sometimes read immediately, sometimes delayed by seconds, or not at all.  It seems somewhat random, and not obviously tied to processing power or memory.
